### Introduction
A Simple Influencer App which was developed by me as an Internship assignment.<br/>
This Android App has been developed using Java and has been designed keeping minimalism and clean layout in mind. The App uses ConstraintLayout in layout files. There is no API part for the app as this was just a UI challenge.
